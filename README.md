# DCIT201-into_to_java

# Introduction to Java Assignment

Welcome to your first Java assignment! In this exercise, you will apply the basic concepts of Java programming to solve a problem. This assignment will test your understanding of variables, control structures, and basic input/output operations.

---

## Problem Statement

### **Temperature Converter**

Write a Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Your program should:

1. Prompt the user to choose between the following options:
   - Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
   - Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
2. Take the temperature value as input from the user.
3. Perform the conversion based on the user's choice using the following formulas:
   - **Celsius to Fahrenheit:** `F = (C × 9/5) + 32`
   - **Fahrenheit to Celsius:** `C = (F - 32) × 5/9`
4. Display the converted temperature in a user-friendly format.

## Requirements
- Use a `Scanner` object to read input from the user.
- Validate user input to ensure correct data is entered (e.g., numbers for temperature, 1 or 2 for the option).
- Include appropriate comments in your code to explain its functionality.
- Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid input, extreme temperatures).

---

## Submission Instructions
1. Save your program file as `TemperatureConverter.java`.
2. Submit the `.java` file to the assignment portal before the deadline.
3. Ensure your program compiles and runs without errors.
